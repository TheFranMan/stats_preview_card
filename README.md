## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- A11y attributes


### What I learned

This was my first time working with the `srcset` and `sizes` html attributes, as well as the `mix-blend-mode` css property. Took awhile to understand and apply them correctly, but in the end I got there.

I've also started including a11y best pratices. I've just started learning about this and I'm feeling it out as I go.

### Continued development

   - More a11y.
   - Better undxerstanding of the `mix-blend-mode` property and its values/uses.

### Useful resources

- [srcset & sizes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QYpkrX2N48) - Really good explaination of the `srcset` and `sizes` html attributes.
